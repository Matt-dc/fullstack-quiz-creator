# Full-stack Quiz Creator

## Overview
This is a full-stack MERN app that allows users to create their own quizzes and then run them. Styling is done using Materialize.css.

### Why build it?
Selecting options while clicking through various screens seemed to be a model which is quite applicable to a range of app ideas I had, and thus I decided to begin with something that seemed manageable.

### Edit Quiz
Quizzes are fully editable, which includes both quiz and question images, and which are sent through to the back end and handled using Multer.

### Future Development
An initial improvement to the app would be unit and component Tests. Aside from this, implementation of a login system and some kind of user scoreboard functionality as well as user statistics that display average user results on quizzes and records quiz history would be natural next steps.
