### Why build it?
Selecting options while clicking through various screens seemed to be a model which is quite applicable to a range of app ideas I had, and thus I decided to begin with something that seemed manageable.

## Third Party
The app is build upon the MERN stack, 


### Future Development
Tests would be an initial improvement to the app. Aside from this, I would like to implement a login system and some kind of scoreboard functionality as well as stats that display average user results on quizzes,
